# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in this project.

This repository explores a **design-time compiler for AI agents**.
It is intentionally **compile-only** — not a runtime or execution framework.

## What contributions are welcome
- Design discussions around agent topology selection
- Deterministic rules for intent → structure mapping
- Examples of real-world agent intents and compiled plans
- Improvements to documentation and clarity
- Thoughtful issues that explore edge cases or governance concerns

## What is out of scope (for now)
- Runtime execution engines
- Tool-calling implementations
- Autonomous agent planning logic
- Prompt engineering or chain-of-thought tuning

## How to contribute
1. Open an issue to discuss the idea first
2. Keep changes small and focused
3. Prefer clarity over completeness

This project is early and exploratory.
The goal is learning in public, not feature velocity.
